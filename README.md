# Event Guest List Manager

**📚 Project Description**
The Event Guest List Manager is a simple, interactive web application that lets you manage your event’s guest list directly from your browser.

It allows you to:

- Add new guests with their name, category, and timestamp.

- Edit guest details afterwards.

- Mark a guest as Attending or Not Attending.

- Remove a guest from the list when needed.

- Limit the number of guests to 10, with a notification when attempting to add more.

This application is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and fully functional without requiring a page reload.

All functionality is implemented with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — no libraries or frameworks.
